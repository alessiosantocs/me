# intro
I'm a full-stack software engineer, with over a decade of experience building complex, scalable applications that are a joy to use for the end user and easy to maintain for the team.

# my work
**At HYNS**, I developed a user-friendly learning app using `Ruby on Rails`, `Turbo`, and `Stimulus.js`, now serving thousands of members worldwide.

In addition, I built various integrations and internal tools to support the team, including:

1. **Canva Integration Tool**: Converts any Canva document into a personalized assessment, using custom variables and pulling data from Google Sheets or Jotform.
2. **Automation Functions**: Developed custom functions to seamlessly connect third-party apps, automating essential business tasks that were previously handled manually.
3. **AI Content Generation Assistant**: Created an AI assistant capable of reading books, accessing internal and external APIs, and executing actions via API, enhancing content generation and workflow efficiency.

**At MyMaison**, I developed a user-friendly solution to help Airbnb hosts and property managers navigate Italy's complex regulatory requirements, turning a traditionally cumbersome process into a seamless experience.

The project began as a straightforward `Ruby on Rails` app, using `Bootstrap` and `jQuery`. As the app evolved, I introduced components built with `Angular.js` and eventually transitioned to `React.js` for a more robust front-end. On the backend, I optimized performance and scalability through query and view enhancements, as well as code refactoring. Additionally, I developed several supporting microservices using `Node.js` to enhance the app's functionality and efficiency.

**At Pazienti.it**, I contributed to several key projects, including:
1. **Adopting Angular.js**: Introduced Angular.js to develop interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
2. **Real-Time Video Consultation**: Designed and built a real-time patient-doctor video consultation platform from the ground up.
3. **CMS Enhancements**: Added new features to improve the team’s custom-built content management system.

# other projects
Here are four standout projects that, while unrelated to my core work, are worth highlighting:

1. **Accounting Tool**: A streamlined, efficient solution for importing bank transactions, reconciling and categorizing them, and generating comprehensive financial reports. Developed in just a few weeks.

3. **User Tracking Tool**: A cross-site tracker that helps businesses identify the sources of both paid and organic leads with ease.
4. **Kid-Friendly Learning App**: A parent-curated educational platform for children aged 5-12, offering ad-free YouTube content to foster learning and development.
5. **Chrome Extension and Backend Integration for Health Clinic**: Developed a complex Chrome extension and robust backend API for one of Italy's largest private health clinics. The extension enhanced the user interface of Dentally, adding new features and acting as a bridge to a third-party app for issuing electronically signed invoices. Most of the heavy lifting was managed by the backend API, which facilitated seamless integration between the two systems. Additionally, I often had to reverse engineer Dentally’s functionality to deliver features that were not publicly available, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.
