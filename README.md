# intro
I'm a full-stack software engineer, with over a decade of experience building complex, scalable applications that are a joy to use for the end user and easy to maintain for the team.

# my work
**At HYN**S, I've designed and built an easy-to-use learning app in `Ruby on Rails`, `Turbo` and `Stimulus.js`, used by thousands of members globally:

I've also created integrations and internal tools to support the team:
- a tool to turn any **Canva** document into a personalised assessment, with **custom variables**, fetching user data from either a Google Sheet or Jotform
- custom self-contained functions to connect different third-party apps, automating critical business tasks previously performed manually by the team
- an AI content generation assistant, with capabilities such as reading books, accessing internal and external APIs, and performing actions via API

**At MyMaison**, I've built an intuitive solution to help airbnb owners and property managers comply with Italy's complex regulations, making a cumbersome and painful process a walk in the park:

This project started as a "simple" `Ruby on Rails` app, using `Bootstrap` and `jQuery`.
Over the years, as the complexity of the app increased, I've built components in `Angular.js` and finally transitioned to `React.js`.
On the backend, as the app became more popular I had to learn how to scale it efficiently using both query and view optimizations, as well as refactoring slow code.
To support the main application I've also built several micro-services in `Node.js`.

At Pazienti.it, although I don't have any screens to share, I've worked on a bunch of interesting projects:
- introducing the use of Angular.js for building interactive UIs
- building a real-time patient-doctor video consultation service from scratch
- adding features to the team's internal, custom built CMS

# other projects
There are only three notable projects that are completely unrelated to my work and that I feel are worth sharing:
1. An incredibly sleek and fast accounting tool I built in a couple of weeks to rapidly input a company's transactions, categorise them, then generate reports at the speed of thought. **Like Pocketsmith but faster :D**
2.
