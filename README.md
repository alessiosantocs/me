# intro
I'm a full-stack software engineer, with over a decade of experience building complex, scalable applications that are a joy to use for the end user and easy to maintain for the team.

# my work
**At HYN**S, I've designed and built an easy-to-use learning app in `Ruby on Rails`, `Turbo` and `Stimulus.js`, used by thousands of members globally:

**At MyMaison**, I've built an intuitive solution to help airbnb owners and property managers comply with Italy's complex regulations, making a cumbersome and painful process a walk in the park:

This project started as a simple `Ruby on Rails` app, using `Bootstrap` and `jQuery` at first.
Over the years, as the complexity of the app increased, I've built components in `Angular.js` and finally transitioned to `React.js`.

To support the main application I've also built several micro-services in `Node.js`.
